### Why is it Important to be POSITIVE?

I believe POSITIVITY is important because it helps us feel stronger inside. At the
end of the day I like to reflect on the day and think of the positive moments that
happened. When I think back on my day, I realize I am a much stronger person and
feel more fortunate to have people around me. I also feel that positivity makes me
laugh and smile more and complain less. It helps me feel joyful inside and less
fearful. I feel less stressed and more likely to say “Yes” than “no”. I believe positivity
helps me improve my skills and overcome my challenges. My theory is being
positive will improve life in countless ways. It will help us strive to accomplish new
goals and more easily succeed in life.
