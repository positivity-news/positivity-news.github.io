“This fawn was taking a short
snooze near my house and didn't
even wake up when we cut the
grass! The second picture is from a
video of the mom approaching our
house (very carefully) to make sure
he got back into the woods safely!”

#### Felix and his family

**were wondering if they
could do something for
their community. His
mom was looking on
Twitter and she saw
that people all over the
world were making
“Free Little Food
Pantries,” like the Free
Little libraries, so she
wanted to build one for
their community.
Together with Felix’s
family and his Aunt and
her family they began to
build it. It was difficult
working with his little
brother and cousin
because they could not
do a lot of work and got
bored easily. Now that
the Free Little Food
Pantry is done, it is fully
stocked and ready to be
used. Their neighbors
and family helped stock
the “Little Free Food
Pantry” to help out
those in their
community who need it.**

“Dogs are a human’s best
friend mainly because they're
supportive and loyal towards
us, which is why my family
and I adopted one two
months ago. Rusty is a
bernese mountain doodle.
Although he's very LAZY ,
he's also active sometimes
and his favorite games are
chase, football, fetch (his
rules), and world cup. I think
that Rusty is the best part of
my quarantine and I hope
more people will make the
decision to adopt a dog.” -

“Two nights ago, while walking out along the Great Marsh where I live in
Ipswich and I saw the sun set. I noticed this fan of clouds spanning across
the sky above my home and neighborhood.
Happily, I used my panoramic photo feature on my cell phone (for the first
time) and captured the moment!
This photo brings me comfort as I reflect on what it means to be able to
‘shelter in place’ and to be able to dwell under/in/around such beauty.
Wishing you some glimpses of beauty and moments of peace today.”
