### Mrs. Robinson and her

daughter helped their friend

celebrate her 13th birthday by

driving by her house and

honking their horns along with

many others. Also they called

out the window and wished

her a happy birthday. People

had made signs, decorated

their cars, and all drove in a

big loop by the house as the

birthday girl and her family

sat outside their house. The

birthday girl was so surprised

and it made her feel really

special. It was also SO great

for all the kids to see their

friends!

```
neighbors are spreading
positivity by painting rocks
for others in their community.
Their sign reads, “Take one
or leave one.” Ms. Heddon
plans to paint a rock and add
it to the collection. How
neighborly, Ms. Heddon!

### Mrs. Blanchard Gardening with Family

##### Over the weekend Mrs. Blanchard has been growing plants with her

##### family. “Helping with yard work was a wonderful way for all of us to be

##### together but remain safely apart. We all worked outside in different

##### areas and we all felt a great sense of accomplishment at the end of the

##### day.” Mrs. Blanchard enjoyed watching her three year old grandson

##### push a miniature wheelbarrow around the yard! Like most people at

##### this time, Mrs. Blanchard has missed seeing her family members as

##### much as she used to. “This had two benefits: it helped me with the

##### important task of spring clean-up and it gave our family a chance to

##### connect.”

#### “I’ve noticed that people have been doing kind

#### chalk on their driveways, and when it is raining

#### they put up stuffed animals in their windows.”
