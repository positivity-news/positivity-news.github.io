### Acts of Kindness in our Local Communities since

### the Pandemic

##### Positive Activities

```
Neighborhoods are participating in
programs like "Chalk the Walk,"
"Door to Door" or "Bear Hunt" in which
residents make others who are
walking or driving by smile:
```
```
Chalk the Walk: Write encouraging
messages on the sidewalk for
essential workers.
```
```
Door to Door: Decorate your front
door with a theme. (Mrs. Turnbull’s
theme was spring , and this week it's
baseball .)
```
```
Bear Hunt: Put a bear in your window
and then families can go on a "bear
hunt" and see how many bears they
can find while walking or driving
around town.
```
```
Helping Elderly Neighbors
```
**_- A student in the middle school lives
in a large condominium building in
Boston. Some of the residents are
elderly and others have very young
children and are working from home.
A program called, "Neighbors
Helping Neighbors" was started.
Neighbors can help others by buying
groceries for those in need or
checking in on those who are lonely.
- Children play music for their elderly
neighbors who are self isolating._**

#### Kindness on campus before the

#### Keys to a Better Me!

##### By Clara Steffen

There are many keys that

Landmark elementary students can earn each

day. The keys are **Respect, Kindness,**

**Patriotism, Responsibility, Self-Advocacy,**

**Honesty, Persistence, Courge** and **Feelings.**

Middle school students can earn wristbands

for doing positive acts. Showing these

positive qualities makes us feel successful

during our school year. Personally, I felt good

about myself when I once earned a Kindness

Key because another student said I am kind

to others who attend Landmark.
