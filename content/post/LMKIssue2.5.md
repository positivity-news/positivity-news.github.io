We are very grateful and thankful to the faculty and students that sent us uplifting

articles. Unfortunately, this is the final issue of the year, so we hope you have an

amazing summer. Remember to not let the negativity over rule you.

The InterCultural Group gathered together for their last meeting. We had special alumni

visitors, Ethan, Nathaniel and Landon, who shared impactful advice and celebrated our

graduating seniors.

The InterCultural Group Special Last Meeting This Year


Derek and Mitchell joined the celebration virtually.


###### As a tradition, the InterCultural Group drank Greek coffee and

###### we welcomed Ethan back to Landmark.


“I wanted to share that the students in my first period worked together to create a project where
they compared the prices between Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. They were able to present it
to Mr. Craig and with his help, we got approved to go on a field trip to Dunkin to test out
research! We went on May 26th and it was really fun, especially after so many of them took
MCAS last week! I attached a few screenshots from their powerpoint!”

Mrs. Malay

#### Field Trip


**“Last week our period 1 biology class went down the road to help Mr. Fallon at the Beverly Farms**

**Gardens. Mr. Fallon plants vegetables that he donates to local food pantries. He has donated**

**thousands of pounds of vegetables since he started the garden a few years ago. Our class helped**

**plant some flowers to decorate the corners of the garden”. - Mrs. Kuhns**

### Gardening


**“On Monday, June 6, we conducted our last community service project of the school year. Derek, Lola**

**and Naomi went with Rev. Ferg. to Life Bridge Homeless Shelter to provide dinners for those less**

**fortunate. The job now is very different than it was before Covid. Now much of what we do is prep**

**dinners and then set them up as "To-Go" meals because many of the people now eat off site. This week,**

**we served chicken stir fry over rice and salad along with some delicious desserts. We'll be back again on**

**Monday October 3. Come join us!” - Reverend Ferguson**
