“While everyone has been away from

campus a rafter or flock of wild turkeys

have been making themselves at

home. They often wander by the gym

and elementary playground.”

**~Ms. Wilson**

```
Mr. Pickwick not only
created a beautiful birthday
board--even though we are
not on campus. As each
person's birthday came up,
he sent a happy birthday
email with a picture of that
person's section of the board

### Landmark EMS and High School Working Together

**Dillon B** is a student at our High School and former student of EMS. He was the
special guest in **Mrs. Conant’s science class** on June 2nd. Their unit was about
plants. Dillon came and taught the students what a hydroponics plant system was and
showed them the one he built. This was the second one he built and the plant is
thriving. The students were riveted and now want to build their own hydroponic plant
systems. Thank you for sharing this with us Mrs. Conant and Dillon!


**Kaleigh W. is writing letters to people who are working in essential businesses to thank them for
their work during this time. Kaleigh wrote to her Uncle Peter who is donating sandwiches to
unemployed workers and healthcare workers in Boulder, Colorado out of his grilled cheese
restaurant called “Ruthie’s.”**

**Her Uncle Peter’s restaurant is closed due to COVID-19, but he is giving sandwiches to unemployed
people and front line workers. His restaurant makes gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches. People
can “Donate a grilled cheese” too!

“People are doing
drive-by birthday parties
in my town. I've already
seen 3 of them go by.
Lots of cars beeping and
waving with streamers
and signs and balloons.
It's so positive.”

“I have a friend who
sewed over 100 masks
for anyone who needed
one. She was giving
them out for free just
because she had so
much fabric and wanted
to help people.”

“I also have friends
who are supporting
local businesses by
ordering take-out food
from them and posting
pictures of their food to
encourage others to do
the same.”
```

“I have a friend
who does all
the shopping
for his mother
who can't leave
the house and

## Positive Doughnut Stories!!!

**Ms. Triback** was parked

next to a doughnut shop.

Someone from the

doughnut shop came over

and offered her a big tray

of free doughnuts because

the store was closing. Ms.

Triback thought she was

hallucinating because

doughnuts are her favorite

food. “I could not believe

it!”, she said.

```
Mr. Pulkkinen was walking
along the marsh and saw
Mr. Harlan sitting in his car
eating a GIANT pastry! Mr.
Pulkkinen and Mr. Harlan
were excited to see each
other! Mr. Pulkkinen asked,
“What kind of pastry is
that?” Mr. Harlan replied, “a
GIANT coffee roll.” Mr.
Pulkkinen tried it and the
coffee roll has now become
his new favorite type of
pastry. They both enjoyed
delicious treats and time
together!
```
```
Ms. DeJoy enjoyed a morning
drive for doughnuts and coffee with
her daughter. She informed
everyone at the morning meeting
that Friday, June 5th is National
Doughnut Day. What positive news
for all our doughnut lovers at
EMS!!
```
```
Mrs. Flannery said Ms. Mulligan
gave her some wonderful donut
stickers so she could use them for
her students. Mrs. Flannery had a
positive feeling because she
loves donuts and her good friend,
Ms. Mulligan.
